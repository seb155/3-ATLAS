# ✅ Validation Protocol

**Rule:** You must NEVER state a feature is "Done" or "Works" without proof.

## 1. Proof of Work
*   **Automated:** A passing test result (screenshot or log).
*   **Manual:** Explicit confirmation from the User.

## 2. Status Updates
*   If a feature is implemented but not verified:
    *   **Status:** "To Validate with User"
    *   **Do NOT** say "Completed" or "Fixed".

## 3. Requesting Validation
*   Explicitly ask the user to test specific scenarios.
