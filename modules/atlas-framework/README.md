### 💬 Without ATLAS

```
You: "Build me a user authentication system"
Claude: [One AI tries to do everything]
```

### 🏛️ With ATLAS

```
You: "Build me a user authentication system"

ATLAS: "I'll coordinate this. Let me bring in the team..."

    🔧 Backend Builder  → "I'll create the API endpoints and JWT logic"
    🎨 Frontend Builder → "I'll build the login forms and state management"
    🗄️ DevOps Builder   → "I'll set up the database and Docker config"
    📝 Doc Writer       → "I'll document the API when they're done"

    ✅ All working together, automatically.

## 🎯 What is ATLAS?

**ATLAS is an orchestration layer for Claude Code.**

Think of it like this:

| Concept | Analogy |
|---------|---------|
| **Claude Code alone** | One talented freelancer doing everything |
| **Claude Code + ATLAS** | A full tech team with specialists |

ATLAS automatically routes your requests to the right specialist:

- 🔧 **Backend tasks** → Backend Builder
- 🎨 **Frontend tasks** → Frontend Builder
- 🐛 **Bug reports** → Debugger
- 💡 **New ideas** → Brainstorm Agent
- 🏗️ **Architecture questions** → System Architect

**You just describe what you want. ATLAS figures out who should do it.**

## ❓ Why ATLAS?

### 💰 Save Money (80%+)

ATLAS automatically picks the cheapest AI that can handle each task:

| Task | Without ATLAS | With ATLAS |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Fix a typo | Expensive model | Cheap model |
| Write docs | Expensive model | Cheap model |
| Complex architecture | Expensive model | Expensive model ✓ |

**Result:** Only pay for expensive AI when you actually need it.

### 🧠 Never Lose Context

Ever had Claude forget what you were working on?

```
Without ATLAS:
  Session crash → Start over 😫

With ATLAS:
  Session crash → /0-resume → Continue exactly where you left off ✅
```

### 📊 See Everything

Real-time status bar showing:
```
🏛️ ATLAS │ 🧠 Opus │ 🏗️ MyProject │ 💰 $1.23 │ 📝 45K tokens │ ⏱️ 18min
```

You always know what's happening and what it costs.
