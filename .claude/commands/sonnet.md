Invoke the SONNET-DIRECT agent for balanced cost/performance on standard tasks.

This gives you direct access to Claude Sonnet 4.5 without any agent framework overhead or structured response format.

Use `/sonnet` when you need:
- Standard code review
- Medium complexity refactoring
- Direct technical questions
- Cost-conscious operations
- Quick answers without full Opus power

The agent will respond naturally without the standard agent protocol (no Recap, no numbered choices).

Example usage:
```
/sonnet Review this function for potential bugs and suggest improvements
```
