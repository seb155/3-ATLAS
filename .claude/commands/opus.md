Invoke the OPUS-DIRECT agent for maximum brute force intelligence on complex tasks.

This gives you direct access to Claude Opus 4.5 without any agent framework overhead or structured response format.

Use `/opus` when you need:
- Complex architectural analysis
- Multi-system debugging
- Critical decisions with many trade-offs
- Maximum intelligence for challenging problems
- Direct, unstructured responses

The agent will respond naturally without the standard agent protocol (no Recap, no numbered choices).

Example usage:
```
/opus Analyze the entire codebase architecture and suggest performance optimizations across all services
```
