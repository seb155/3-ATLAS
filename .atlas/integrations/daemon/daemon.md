[ABOUT]

My name is Daniel Miessler (MEE-slur) and I'm a Cybersecurity guy turned Cyber/AI guy based out of the San Francisco Bay Area.

My main projects right now are Frame—an AI application building platform, Human 3.0—A system for upgrading humans to prepare for what's coming, and Threshold—an application that filters the internet by what you're guaranteed to like.

I spend most of my time thinking about how AI will change work and society. I live in the Bay Area and write at danielmiessler.com. My goal is pretty simple: help people figure out what they're meant to do with their lives, especially as the world changes rapidly around us.

[CURRENT_LOCATION]

Currently home in the Bay Area

[MISSION]

Increase human Eudaimonia by helping people identify, articulate, and pursue their own purpose in life. Build systems—heavily leveraging the latest in AI—that help people upgrade to the best possible version of themselves (Human 3.0). Transfer (or store) my and B's minds into a format that we can upload into the next (digital) version of our lives.

[TELOS]

TELOS is my personal framework for tracking purpose and direction in life. It's a structured way to document Problems I want to solve, Missions to address them, Goals to achieve, and Metrics to track progress. The name comes from the Greek word for purpose or end goal.

Problems (P) - The most important issues I see in the world that need solving:
- P1: People lack meaning in their lives, and this is about to get far worse because of AI and robotics taking away most traditional jobs
- P2: People are stuck in a 1950's style hierarchical mindset that makes them think they're not one of the "special ones" with ideas and dreams
- P3: People have poor models for how the world works, and the lack the tools to properly improve them

Missions (M) - My approaches to addressing these problems:
- M1: Increase human Eudaimonia by helping people identify, articulate, and pursue their own purpose in life
- M2: Build systems—heavily leveraging the latest in AI—that help people upgrade to the best possible version of themselves (Human 3.0)
- M3: Transfer (or store) my and B's minds into a format that we can upload into the next (digital) version of our lives
